The time of this company which was drafted for three months expired about the first of October 1781. But the company was urged to remain and agreed to remain till the capture of Cornwallis. After Cornwallis surrendered Col Humphreys guarded a number of British prisoners (about 500) to Newlands Ferry on the Potomac River, about 12 miles from Leesburg where they were taken into the charge of the Maryland militia after which Col Humphreys marched his regiment to Leesburg where the whole Regiment was discharged a few days after about the first day of November 1781. 1781 Declarant was out in the service at least three months and twenty five days this time. He was not in any battle this tour except a skirmish when the British attempted to cross the River and were reported. Declarant well remembers Genl Washington Genl Lafayette and Wayne at Yorktown. There were many French officers there also whose names he does not recollect. Genl Washington joined the army in August. Declarant from age and loss of memory, cannot state the names of all the officers who served at the time he was in the service nor all the places through which they marched during his services in the two tours above mentioned, nor the precise time he marched out and returned home, but according to the best of his recollection he marched out and returned the times above mentioned and that he served not less than three months and an half as a private in Capt Emorys Company of Drafted militia and three months and twenty five days as a private in Capt Smiths Company of Drafted militia, in all not less than seven months
