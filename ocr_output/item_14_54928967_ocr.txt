Dear Sir:

Please furnish the Revolutionary War service record, with personal data, of John and Samuel Hough (otherwise, Huff, Hoff or Haugh) who were of London County, Virginia, but probably served in Pennsylvania at one time during the war.

Any data disclosed by the records relating to either "survivors" or "widows" pension of the foregoing will oblige,

Yours truly,
Francis B. Culver
