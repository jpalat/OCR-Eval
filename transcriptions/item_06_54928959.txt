American Army then under the command of Genl. Lafayette and remained with the Army till after the surrender of Lord Cornwallas. The time of this company which was drafted for three months expired about the first of October 1781 but the company was urged to remain and agreed to remain till the capture of Cornwallas. After Cornwallas surrendered Col. Humphrey guarded a number of British prisoners (about 500) at Nowland ferry on the Potomac River, about 12 miles from Leesburg where they were taken into the charge of the Maryland militia after which Col. Humphrey marched his regiment to Leesburg where the whole Regiment was discharged a few days after about the first day of November 1781. Declarant was out in the service at least three months and twenty five days this time. He was not in any battle this time except a skirmish when the British attempted to cross the York River and were repulsed. Declarant well remembers Genl. Washington, Genl. Lafayette and Wayne at Yorktown. There were many French officers there also whose names he does not recollect. Genl. Washington joined the army in August. Declarant from age and loss of memory cannot state the names of all the officers who served at the time he was in the service, nor all the places through which they marched during his service in the two times above mentioned, nor the precise time he marched out and returned home, but according to the best of his recollection he marched out and returned the times above mentioned and that he served not less than three months and a half as a private in the Capt. Emory company of draft militia and three months and twenty five days as a private in Capt. Smith's company of drafted militia, in all not less than seven months
