Gentlemen.
Will you please tell me if you have a Revolutionary record of the following men, two at least of whom were recommended for a "bounty'.  Of course I know this does not necessarily mean a pension, but I am hoping you have some Rev. War record.
Jacob Miller, of Bedford Co. Va. (Franklin)
John or James Huff Loudon Co. Va.
Richard Abbott, Culpepper Co. Va.
Thomas West of Va. or Tenn. (married a Hamilton)

Thanking you for the courtesy, I am
Very truly,
Mattie Lee Huff.
