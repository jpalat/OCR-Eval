Dear Sir:
Please furnish the Revolutionary War service record, with personal data, of John and Samuel Hough (otherwise, Huff, Hoff or Haugh) who were of Loudon County, Virginia, but, probably, served in Pennsylvania at one time during the war.
Any data disclosed by the records relation to either "survivors', or "widows" pension of the foregoing will oblige.
Yours truly,
Francis B. Culver
